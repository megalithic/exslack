# Exslack
## A super basic command-line interface tool to interact with [Slack's (RTM) WSS API](https://api.slack.com/rtm).

#### To do dev things:

```sh
mix deps.get
mix escript.build
```

#### To run the thing:

```sh
./exslack
```

##### There are a number of options, the primary ones are:

- `login` - using a legacy or app token ([more info on that]())
- `quit` - quits the thing
